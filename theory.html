          A   hardwired   control   circuit   can   be   represented   by   conventional hardwired relay ladder diagram. In any hardwired circuit, there should be electrical continuity in order for the load to energize.</p>
          
          <h4 id="basics-about-conventional-ladder-and-plc-ladder-logic-">Basics about conventional ladder and PLC ladder logic :</h4>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">Electrical sequence of operation in hardwired relay circuits can be represented by electrical ladder diagram. Ladder diagram shows the interconnection of field devices. In the ladder diagram, each rung shows how a field device is turned on and also shows how it interacts with next field devices.</p>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">The difference between a PLC ladder program and relay ladder rungs is the  continuity.  In  an  electrical  rung  diagram,  there  is  an  electrical continuity only when the current flows from left power rail to right power rail.</p>
          
          <center>
          <img src="images/LADDER/a1.png" style="height:300px; width:500px;"></center>
          <br>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">Fig (a), shows electrical continuity when SW 1 is closed, as the current flows from L-1 to L-2 energizing the load.</p>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">Even though PLC ladder logic was modeled after the conventional relay ladder, there is no electrical continuity in PLC ladder logic. PLC ladder rungs should have logical continuity in order for the output to energize. PLC ladder program uses familiar terms like "rungs" and "normally open" and    "normally  closed"  contacts,  but  the  relay  ladder  logic  has  no electrical continuity between an input and the controlled output.</p>
          
          <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Note</strong>:- There  is  no  physical  conductor  that  carries  the  input  signal through to the output.</p>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">Each rung in a ladder diagram is a program statement. This program statement consists of a condition or sometimes conditions, along with some type of action. Inputs are the conditions, and the action, or output, is the result of the conditions.</p>
          
          <p style="text-align: justify;">As in case of physical wiring hardware devices connected in series or parallel, PLC also combines ladder program instructions in series or parallel. However, rather than working in series or parallel, the PLC
          combines instructions logically using logic operators. Logical operations performed by PLC are nothing but fundamental logic operation, using fundamental logic operators like: AND, OR, and NOT. These operators are used to combine the instructions on a PLC rung so as to make the outcome of each rung either true or false.

          <h4 id="the-not-logic-function-">The NOT-logic function :</h4>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">A normally closed relay contact passes power any time when the relay coil  is  not  energized. In  the  same manner, the  normally closed PLC ladder logic instruction will pass power any time when the input status file bit associated is  not a  1. In this condition, the physical hardware input is not sending an input signal into the PLC's input module. The opposite of normally open PLC instruction or contact is the NOT logic. NOT logic can be used in conjunction with AND or OR logic, when a logical 0 in the status file is expected to activate some output device. In other words, NOT logic is used when an input is not energized i.e., 0 in the associated status bit, the output should be energized. Also, when the input is energized i.e., 1 in the associated status bit, the output should not be energized.</p>

          <p style="text-align: justify;">When I1 is true i.e. the input status file bit regarding I1 is true (1), the instruction I1 will energize the output. The instruction I1 is considered true when it passes logical continuity. If there is no valid input signal from the field input devices attached to I1's screw terminal on the input module, a logical 0 will be placed in the associated input status file bit. A logical 0 in the input status file will make the normally open input instruction to become false. When normally open instruction is false, it will not pass logical continuity.</p>
          
          <h5 id="analysis-of-rung-2-">Analysis of rung 2 :</h5>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">The normally closed instruction works    much like normally closed contacts on a hardware relay. In the fig (k), when the normally closed instruction I2 is true, i.e. the associated status file bit has a valid zero (0), logical    continuity  is established to energize the output. When the associated status file bit has valid 1, the NC instruction goes false and there is no logical continuity and the output is not energized.</p>

But, in parallel rung, normally closed instruction will be true, as well as normally open instruction will also be true, hence there is logical continuity, and output is energized.</p>

          <p style="text-align: justify;">When I1 = 1 and I2 = 0:<br>
          This case is similar to case 2, only the role of inputs are interchanged i.e. here main rung is true and energizes the output and parallel rung is false.</p>
          
          <h5 id="case-4-">Case 4 :</h5>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">When both inputs are true, the main ladder rung as well as the parallel ladder rung goes false. In main rung, normally open instruction is true but normally closed instruction is false. Hence, there is no logical continuity.    In parallel ladder rung, normally closed instruction is false and normally open instruction is true, and here also there is no logical continuity. Hence, the output is not energized.</p>
          
          <h3 id="timers-">TIMERS :</h3>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">All PLC’s have timer instructions. Timers are output instructions that are internal to the programmable logic controller.
          Timers provide timed control of the devices that they activate or de-activate. </p>

          <ul type="disc" style="text-align: justify;">
          <li>Timers are used to delay an action.</li>
          <li>Timers are used to run an operation for a predetermined period of time.</li>
          <li>Timers are also used to record the total accumulated time of continuous or intermediate events.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h4 id="timers-instructions-">Timer’s instructions :</h4>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">Timers consists of following parts: timer address, preset value, timer base, and accumulated value, as shown in
           figure below. <br>
          </p><center>

          In the above figure , term instruction name is, timer on delay ( TON ), timer base is 1.0 seconds, timer address is T4:0,
          accumulated value of zero(0) and a preset value of 200.<br>
          Each timer instruction has three very useful status bits. These bits are timer enable (E N), timer timing (TT), and timer
          done(DN). <br>
          There are 3 types of timers: On- delay timer, Off-delay timer, and retentive timer.<p></p>
          
          <h4 id="on-delay-timer-">On delay timer :</h4>
          <ul type="disc" style="text-align: justify;">
          <li>Use this instruction to program a time delay after instructions become true. </li>
          <li>On – delay timers are used when an action is to begin a specified time after the input becomes true. For example, a
          certain step in the manufacturing is to begin 45 seconds after a signal is received from a limit switch. The 45- seconds delay
           is the on-delay timers preset value. </li>

          <h4 id="off--delay-timer-">Off- delay timer :</h4>
          <ul type="disc" style="text-align: justify;">
          <li>Off- delay timer instructions is used to program a time delay to begin after rung input goes false. </li>
          <li> As an example, when an external cooling fan on a motor is provided, the fan has to run all the time the motor is running
           and also for certain time (say 10min) after the motor is turned off. This is a ten minute off- delay timer. The ten-minute
           timing period begins as soon as the motor is turned off. </li>

          <h4 id="retentive-timer-">Retentive timer :</h4>
          <ul type="disc" style="text-align: justify;">
          <li>Retentive timer is a timer which retains the accumulated value in case of power loss, change of processor mode or rung
          state going from true to false (rung state transition).</li>
          <li>Retentive timer can be used to track the running time of a motor for its maintenance purpose. Each time the motor is
          turned off, the timer will remember the motor’s elapsed running time. The next time the motor is turned on, the time will
          increase from there. This timer can be reset by using a reset instruction. </li>
          </ul>

          <ul type="disc" style="text-align: justify;">
          <li>This instruction is used to reset the accumulated value of counter or timer. </li>
          <li>It is used to reset a retentive timer’s accumulated value to zero. </li>
          </ul>
          
          <h5 id="a-typical-timer-element">A typical timer element:</h5>

                    Where, T = T identifies this as a timer file. <br>
                                 4 = represents the default timer file 4. <br>
                               <strong> Note</strong>: SLC timer can be assigned any unused file from 9
                                          to 255. <br>
                                :3 = This is timer three in file 4. There are 256 timers
                                        available in each file. Timers 0 through 255 are

          <p>⇒ The status bits of the timer can be addressed in the following way:</p>
          <ul type="disc" style="text-align: justify;">
          <li>Word zero, bit 13, is the done bit. It is identified as DN.
            This bit is set when the timer’s accumulated value is
             equal to the timer’s preset value. It can be addressed as
             T4:3/DN.        </li>
          <li>Word zero, bit 14, is the timer timing bit. It is identified

          <center>fig(c)</center><br>
          The above figure is used to explain the on-delay timer instruction.<br>
          Here, T4:2 represents timer file 4, timer element 2, preset value is 50, accumulated value is 0 and timer base is 1 second.
          Input module is in slot 1 and output module is in slot 2. <br>
          
          <ul type="disc" style="text-align: justify;">
          <li>As long as the instruction I:1/0 is true, the on-delay timer T4:2 will increment every one second toward its preset value
           of 50 seconds. The accumulated value displays the current number of seconds that passed. When the accumulated value
           is equal to the preset value, the timer’s done bit will get energized or set. So when the timer’s done bit gets energized, the
           rung 003, instruction T4:3/DN becomes true and logical continuity is passed and the output O:2/2 gets energized. </li>
          
          <li>As long as the I:1/4 is true, the timer instruction is enabled. Hence, rung 000 becomes true and logical continuity is
          passed and the output O:2/0 is energized. <br>
          Note: An on-delay timer is not retentive in nature.so any loss of continuity to the timer instruction on rung 000 will cause
          the timer to reset itself to an accumulated value of 0. </li>
          <li>When the timer is timing i.e rung 000 is true and accumulated value is less than preset value, timer timing bit(TT) is true.
           So the rung 002 becomes true i.e instruction T4:2/TT is true and output instruction O:2/1 is energized.<br>
          Note: As long as the rung 000 is true i.e instruction I:1/0 is true, the timer instruction is considered enabled. The enable bit
          will be true when the timer timing bit is true. Timer enable bit will be set through the transition from the timer-timing bit to the
           timer-done bit. Timer enable bit is set as long as there is logical continuity through all input instructions to the timer
          instruction, no matter the relationship between the preset value and accumulated value. When the rung goes false, the
           enable bit is reset.  </li>
          </ul>
          
          
          <h4 id="the-off-delay-timer-instruction-">The off-delay timer instruction :</h4>
          <center>
          <img src="images/timer/d.gif" style="height:369px; width:468px"></center>
          <center>fig(d)</center><br>
          The above figure is used to explain the off-delay timer instruction. Here, T4:2 represents timer file 4, timer element 2,
          preset value is 200, accumulated value is 0 and timer base is 1 second. Input module is in slot 1 and output module is in
           slot 2. <br>
          <ul type="disc" style="text-align: justify;">
          <li>As an example, consider an external cooling fan on a motor which has to run all the time when the motor is running and
           also for 200 seconds after the motor is turned off. For this purpose, we use 200- second off-delay timer. The 200-second
           timing cycle begins when the motor is turned off. </li>
          <li> When the instruction I:1/0 is true, the motor is turned on i.e instruction O:2/0 becomes true. In other words, rung 000
          becomes true. When the instruction I:1/0 is true, rung 001 becomes true, which will make the off-delay timer T4:2 enable.
           So as long as the instruction I:1/0 is true, the timer enable bit, EN, is true and hence, rung 002 become true, which inturn
          makes the output instruction O:2/1 true. The done bit is set as long as the rung 001 is true i.e the done bit is set when the
           enable bit is set. So the rung 004 is true. Hence, the external cooling fan is energized i.e instruction O:2/3 is true. So at
          this point, both motor and external cooling fan are energized. </li>
          <li>When the motor is turned off, i.e the instruction I:1/0 becomes false, the output instruction O:2/0( motor) becomes false
          and motor is turned off. When rung 001 transitions from true to false, the TOF( off-delay timer) instruction begins timing.
          The done bit and the external cooling fan( O:2/3) will still remains on, or true, for the preset value of 200 seconds. The time
          period between the point when the rung becomes false and the point when the 200 seconds preset time expires for T4:2 is
           called delay after the input goes false, or the off-delay. The timers done bit and its associated output stay true until the
           off-delay of 200- seconds expires. The time expires when the accumulated value reaches the preset value. When the input
          instruction I:1/0 goes from true to false, the timer enable bit (EN) is reset and timer timing bit(TT) is set. The timer will start
           timing at this point. The timer timing bit(EN) becomes true whenever the rung transitions from true to false and the
          accumulated value is less than the preset value.<br>
          Note: The timer done bit, bit 13, is set when the rung 000 becomes true. It will remain set through the true to false transition
           and until the accumulated value is equal to the preset value. This bit is commonly used to control the other logic when an
           output needs to be turned-on or turned-off after its rung has been off for the preset time interval. </li>
          </ul>
          
          
          <h4 id="the-retentive-timer-instruction-">The retentive timer instruction :</h4>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">Retentive timer instruction is used when we want to retain the accumulated value through power loss, processor mode
           change, or change in the rung state from true to false. The retentive timer instruction will measure the cumulative time
           period for which its rung is true. One of the example of retentive timer is that, it can be used to track the running time of a
          motor for maintenance purpose. The retentive timer is used to track the accumulated time the motor has run. In our example
          , our motor needs maintenance after 3600 seconds or, one hour of running time. Each time the motor is turned off, the timer
          needs to remember the motors total elapsed running time. The next time the motor is turned on, the timer will increase the
           accumulated running time from where it is left off. When the total accumulated motor running time has been reached, a
          maintenance remainder pilot light will be lit. A retentive timer is used in this application.</p>
          <center>
          <img src="images/timer/e.gif" style="height:379px; width:577px"></center>
          <center>fig(e)</center><br>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">Here, T4:2 represents timer file 4, timer element 2, preset value is 3600, accumulated value is 0 and timer base is 1
           second. Input module is in slot 1 and output module is in slot 2. <br>
          The retentive timer on, RTO instruction, behaves similar to the timer-on delay instruction, with exception that when the RTO
          instruction goes false, it will retain its accumulated value. <br>
          The retentive timer will retain its accumulated value during the following conditions: </p>
          <ul type="disc" style="text-align: justify;">
          <li>When its rung goes false.</li>
          <li>When processor losses power. But, the battery for memory back up must be in good condition. </li>
          <li>When the processor faults. </li>
          <li>When the processor operating mode is changed from remote run or remote test to remote program mode.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h5 id="associated-status-bit-">Associated status bit :</h5>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">The timer done bit, bit 13, is set when the accumulated value is equal to the preset value. For our application, the done
           bit and output O:2/0 could control the maintenance reminder pilot light. <br>
          Timer timing bit(TT), bit 14, is on rung 002. This bit is set anytime the rung conditions are true and the timer times. The timer
          times whenever the rung is true and the accumulated value is less than the preset value. When the done bit is set, the
          timer timing bit resets. So in our example, the timer timing bit will be set or true, whenever input I:1/0 is true and as long as
           the accumulated value is less than the preset value of 3600 seconds. Output O:2/1 will be on or true when the timer is
           timing between 0 second and 300 seconds. As the done bit is set and O:2/0 turns on, the timer timing bit goes false and
           O:2/1 turns off. <br>
          The timer enable bit, 15, is set or true , anytime the timer instruction rung 000 is true. As long as the instruction I:1/0 is true,
          the timer instruction is considered enabled. The enable bit is true when the timer-timing bit is true and it will stay set through
           the transition from the timer-timing bit to the timer done bit.</p>
          
          <h5 id="the-reset-instruction">The reset instruction:</h5>
          <p style="text-align: justify;">In order to reset the accumulated value of retentive timer, a reset instruction is used. The address of the reset instruction
           must match the address of the timer that is to be reset. Only one address is allowed per reset instruction. In rung 004,
           I:1/1 instruction is used to reset the timer T4:2. This signal comes from a momentary normally open push button field
          device, connected to input screw terminal 1. Pressing this push button will reset the RTO’s accumulated value back to 0. </p>
          
          <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>NOTE</strong>: Retentive timer off instruction behaves similar to the timer-off delay with the exception that when the
           instruction goes from false to true, it will retain , or remember, its accumulated value.</p>
